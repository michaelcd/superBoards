[X] - Implement Card component (basic list item with title to start)
[X] - Implement Board Archival
[X] - CSS styling - board detail page, cards
[X] - Card creation inside List
[X] - NewList + NewCard component: retains previous new list name after list created

[ ] - BoardMenu component

[ ] - Archived Boards View
[ ] - CardDetailView for CRUD options
[ ] - Change BoardsController#show to retrieve only non-archived cards

Friday
[ ] - Drag and drop
[ ] - React Auth
[ ] - Board Sharing

Outstanding issues:

- Refactor List controller and views (right now duplicates board partials)
- Logout button somewhere (temporary version)
- Minor issue: Value persists in Create Board form after board creation; will later
route to BoardDetailView so should be a nonissue;
- refactor: no camel case names in CSS class names. prefer dashed names
- File upload: attachments to cards

Review Lily's email
- Board sharing
- Style and seed as you go
